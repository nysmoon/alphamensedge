	<h1>Freqently Asked Questions</h1>
        <b>Q. Will Test-Boost X cause me to test positive for steroids?</b>

naturally increase your body's ability to create more testosterone. 
        </p>
        <b>Q. Is Test-Boost X safe?</b>
        <p>
        A. Test-Boost X uses only safe, all natural ingredients that have been used for centuries around the world. There are very few side effects for some of the ingredients in Test-Boost X so before taking it we recommend that you consult a physician to see if it is right for you. The side effects reported in studies were, in rare cases, for nettle root; gastrointestinal discomfort, dehydration, lower blood pressure (not bad unless you suffer from low blood pressure or are already on medication for high blood pressure) and lower blood clotting due to its ability to thin the blood and increase blood flow. If you feel you are having a reaction, discontinue use and call 911 or your local emergency services immediately.

        <p>A. For best results, use as directed while eating a healthy balanced diet and exercising regularly. Please note that although Test-Boost X is not a diet pill or fat burner, those who have excess body fat are likely to lose it as a result of increased testosterone and will see the fastest results by adding proper nutrition and exercise.
