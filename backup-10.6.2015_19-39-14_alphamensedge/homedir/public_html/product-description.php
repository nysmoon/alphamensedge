      <b>Steve R.</b>
      <p>Hello, I will be starting my second bottle, in a few days, and so far, it seems to be helping me. I love that your product is all natural. I have tried more testosterone pills, than I can remember, most with ingredients I don't want in my body. I also really appreciate your pricing and I am happy and satisfied with your product. Thank You, and keep up the great job!</p>
      <b>Chad K.</b>
      <p >My name is Chad K, I am 46 years old and I took Alpha Men’s Edge Nutrition Test-Boost X 4X daily from 3/1-3/31/13. I weighed myself at the start of the test and at the end. I originally weighed in at 258 at 19.8% body fat and on 4/1 I weighed in at 252 and 16.6% body fat for a total net gain of 3 lbs. of lean body mass.

After about 7 days into taking Test-Boost, I noticed that I was sleeping much better, able to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night sometimes more (usually I can only sleep for 4-5 hours at a time then lay awake the rest of the night).

My work outs have improved, I felt much stronger, I no longer lift heavy weights but I found myself able to lift more and more without any joint pain.
</p>
      <p>
An added benefit to this is I noticed my sex drive and stamina has also drastically improved. Good for me, bad for my wife…..
      
Because of my age, I was a bit concerned with my blood pressure going up so I closely monitored it every morning. Day one BP was 132/78, day 30, 118/74. 

The only other supplements I took during this was a baby aspirin daily and 2-400mg pills of Lecithin which, I was taking regularly well before me taking Test-Boost X. 

I am going to continue using this product; I have found no ill side effects and have only noticed positive results. Good luck!!</p>
